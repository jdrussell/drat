## In No Particular Order Yet

- Pushing directly to GitHub would be nice to have eventually if we can get
  hold of a package without too many extra depends

- Supporting binary package would nice but it lower priority

- Signing the PACKAGES file via gpg (a la Debian) would be a nice
  step. Validation would be needed as well.

- Supports GH orgs
