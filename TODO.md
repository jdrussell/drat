## In No Particular Order Yet

- Pushing directly to GitHub would be nice to have eventually if we can get
  hold of a package without too many extra depends. Possible requirements:
  + switching to gh-pages (and back)
  + commit
  + push
  [ Added on Jan 28 via simple system() call; needs more robust interface ]

- Supporting binary packages (for Windows and maybe OS X) would nice but is
  lower priority -- especially as R now tries bianry _and_ source

- Signing the PACKAGES file via gpg (a la Debian) would be a nice
  step. Validation would be needed as well.

- Supports GH orgs? That is just an account name after all.
