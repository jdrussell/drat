}
\value{

containing columns with columns \dQuote{file}, \dQuote{package}
(just the name), \dQuote{version} and a logical variable
\dQuote{newest} indicating if the package can be removed.

\description{
The function determines which packages in a repositories can be
removed as they are being \sQuote{shadowed} by a newer version of
the same packages.
}
\details{
Given a package name, R will always find the newest version of
that package. Older versions are therefore effectively shadowed
and can be removed without functionally changing a repository.
